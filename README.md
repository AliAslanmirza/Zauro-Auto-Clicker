# Zauro-Auto-Clicker
I made an auto clicker application with c#. This application, unlike the others, has a special settings tab. If you want to try it, you can download the source code or if you don't want to mess with it, you can directly upload the exe file that I have published.

# Downnload
exe from the Direct Download section. You can download it as a file or you can download the source file, open it in Visual Studio, build and start it.

# Platform
Currently available only for Windows OS.

# Settings

## 1·Click Interval
This setting is your click interval. The working style changes from computer to computer (I couldn't quite understand this either). When you increase it in some, it increases to an incredible click speed, while in others it slows down. You can find out by trying it yourself.

## 2·Stop After ... Mins
This setting comes into effect after running the program and waits until the minute you enter it, then stops clicking.

##### Not: if it stays 0 the setting will not be active

## 3·Stop After ... Clicks
This setting clicks the screen as many times as you enter in the box and then stops.

##### Not: if it stays 0 the setting will not be active

## 4·Always On Top
This setting keeps the program always on top. As soon as you open the program, it will open automatically because without this setting, the program may not work well for your computer.

## 5·Minimize
In theory, it makes the program tiny and less space-consuming. However, it does not work in the current version (1.1.1). It's under development and I'm trying to make it most useful.

## 6·Button Selection
The issue I'm going to talk about here is not for the normal left click, but for the right click. Because right click doesn't work well. Be careful when using it and do not change the recommended setting (Stop After: 10 Clicks).

## 6·Start Stop
The start and stop buttons work, but the shortcut key I want to inform here is F7. If it does not work even though you press the F7 key, click on any part of the program to bring it to the top. I'm trying to fix this problem but I haven't gotten anywhere so far. I'll try to fix this in other versions.
